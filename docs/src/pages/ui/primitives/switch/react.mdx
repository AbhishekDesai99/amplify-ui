Switch is a toggle switch

## Demo

<SwitchDemo />

## Usage

The most basic usage simply includes a switchField component passing in a required label prop.

```jsx
import { SwitchField } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';

<SwitchField label={'This is a switch'} />;
```

<Example>
  <SwitchField label={'This is a switch'} />
</Example>

## isChecked

The `isChecked` property is a `boolean` value and defines if the switch is on or off. This is a boolean property and being set to either true or false will change this into a controlled switchField which can only be switched on or off using this controlled value.

## defaultChecked

The `defaultChecked` property is a `boolean` value and will define the starting value for an uncontrolled switchField.

## thumbColor

The `thumbColor` property is a CSS color value and will define the color of the thumb in the switchField.

## trackColor

The `trackColor` property is a CSS color value that will define the color of the track of the switchField while in the off position.

## checkedTrackColor

The `checkedTrackColor` property is a CSS color value that will define the color of the track of the switchField while in the on position.

## isDisabled

The `isDisabled` property is a `boolean` value that when set to true will disable the switchField from being toggled to on or off.

## name

The `name` property is a `string` that defines the name of the field that will be submitted with the form as a name/value pair.

## size

The `size` property is an `enum` value that modifies the size of the switchField component. The available sizes are `small`, (default), and `large`.

## label

The `label` property is a required `string` or `ReactNode` that will display next to the switchField component and wrapped in an html label tag.

## isLabelHidden

The `isLabelHidden` property is a `boolean` value that will visually hide the label.

## value

The `value` property is a `string` value that defines the value of the field that will be submitted with the form as a name/value pair.

## onChange

The `onChange` property is a callback `function` that will be called with a change event to the switchField.
